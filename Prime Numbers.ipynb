    "Prime numbers are vastly used in our everyday lives becuase of how simple they are. Their simplicity makes it near impossible to break down and you can produce so much with something so simple. Everytime you pick up your phone you are using prime numbers, algorithms are created using prime numbers for communication security and for transmission of information. mathematicians and computer scientists alike find it almost impossible to generate an efficient formula for factoring numbers into primes, which is why they're so good for security purposes. It is not to say we do not have ways of factoring prime numbers but when we try to factor a 300-digit number or a 800-digit number, the algorithms we've formulated to factor lets say the number 1246, the algorithm would take an insane amount of time to factor the 300 or 800 digit number. Since there is a limit to the amount of prime numbers we can factor that makes it perfect for security, since no one can get to the core. \n",

    "  Part 1 (i) of this project is written to output a list of prime numbers that are less than n, not including n. We begin with our function 'ListPrimes' which is meant to take in an integer n. Before we begin we want to make sure our outputs, results, are being put into a list so we write primeList = [ ] which inserts any results we obtain from our code into a list of the name primeList. We begin with a condition \"if $n < 2$: print(\"Enter a number that is larger than 2.\") which states that if you try to input a number less than 2 it will let you know that you cannot try that number, this is made because we only want positive integers and also numbers larger than 2 becasue 1(mention why 1 is not a prime in the intro) is not considered a prime number. \n",

The round(n) function then rounds 9.7 to 10 and then continues to run smoothly. Our next condition is a for loop which is going to take a variable 'm' in the function list from the range of 2 to n. Next comes our 'test' which is meant to test the input n with our CheckPrime() function we wrote above. We need to call it first, so we assign test to our CheckPrime() function so that when we input our integer n the code calls the CheckPrime() above and checks all the integers smaller than our n and determines if they prime numbers or not. After we conclude which integers are prime we want to add them to our empty list primeList = [] so we include the function primeList.append() which appends, adds, all the integers that are prime and less than n to the list primeList = []. Finally our return function spits out a list of prime numbers that are less than n, if all the code before it passed all of our conditions."

We begin with our function nPrimes(): and immediately we write 'out = 1,' the reason why we do this is becasue we want to assume our first input is correct, this detail is important to the code. Assume the code is like a game, everytime you defeat a boss you continue to the next level.

The while loop will check if the value of k is a prime by calling upon our old yet raliable function CheckPrime() and if the value is a prime it will append it to the list nPrime. The function then tells K to add a value of 1 to itself and to begin the process again, checking to see if the value is a prime and if it is a prime then it will append the value to the string and henceforth until the value of n is reached, then it will return the list of the n prime numbers in order from largest to smallest.\n",

If the time is $6:00$ , 8 hours later it will be $2:00$. At first this doesnt seem to make sense since $6 + 8 = 14$ but this is not correct since time \"Wraps around\" every 12 hours so we can confidently say that 12 is congruent to 0 modulo 12, since every time you pass 12 the clock resets to 0. \n",

We always return out because 'out' returns the values that tells us whether we did good or bad.  Our for argument states that for and a in range from $i$ all the way to our input $p$ we want to make sure that our $p$ is a prime and if we use the congruence relation we described above we can get it correct almost every time so by inserting (pow(a, p, p) into our code we get a part of it but we need to compare it to another value to make sure p is always a prime so we have to make sure that\n",

Prime numbers are impenetrable shields becuase they are so simple and they take so long to crack. Modules are extremely important to cybersecurity because they can used to generate very long lists of prime numbers that would take hackers many years to decode, which is very safe for us and for the future. Prime numbers are used in Cryptocurrency to make keys, public keys and private keys, these keys are then distributed, the private to customers for specific one on one interations online.  \n",

Prime numbers are very easy to formulate but they are very difficult to break down and this is what makes them so important. A great example of this was shown in the code we made today. The program is very fast with computing prime numbers but when it came to breaking them down the python program slowed down and took more time to get the answers we desired.\n",

Functions need to be extremely precise in order to carry out their demands to work properly. Our Project consisted of making multiple functions that would be able to take in any integer and either output a list of primes less than said integer or the equivalent number of integers as our input digit, our code consisted of many loops and statements to make sure we could be perfectionists and make sure we could get outputs that were desirable.  We created algorithms to go into our statements to make our code work as efficiently as possible. We were asked to create similar functions to compare them to our initial function and see how they differ and what comparisons could be made from those differences and what those differences meant in the world of prime numbers."
